# bulk-command-generator
In conjuction with TF2Autobot, this script is a handy tool to generate bulk commands for pricelist manipulation

# Why?
As I expand my bot's pricelist, I come across items that are numbered, such as crates. I am creating this mainly to add crates easily. However, I have ideas to expand to different kinds of items.
 - Ideas
   - Killstreak weapons, as all names contain "Killstreak", "Specialized Killstreak", and "professional Killstreak"
   - Unusuals, as all particle names in unusuals are the same.
   - General SKUs (ex: 1;6, 2;6 etc). Obviously, not all SKUs will be valid, but it still fulfills the goal of adding a LOT of items.
